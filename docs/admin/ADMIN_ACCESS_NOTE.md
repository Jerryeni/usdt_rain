# Admin Access Configuration

## Who Has Admin Access

The admin dashboard (`/admin`) is accessible to:

1. **Contract Owner** (Primary Admin)
   - The wallet address that deployed the contract
   - Has full control over all contract functions
   - Set during contract deployment

2. **First Registered User** (User ID 1)
   - The first user to register on the platform
   - Also has full admin access
   - Useful for platform founders/early adopters

## Why First User Has Access

This configuration is useful for:
- **Platform Founders**: The first user is typically the platform founder
- **Testing**: Easy access during development and testing
- **Backup Admin**: Provides a backup admin in case owner wallet is unavailable
- **Operational Flexibility**: Allows operational team member to have admin access

## How It Works

The `useIsOwner` hook checks:
```typescript
1. Is the connected wallet the contract owner?
   └─ Yes → Grant admin access
   └─ No → Continue to next check

2. Is the connected wallet user ID 1?
   └─ Yes → Grant admin access
   └─ No → Deny access and redirect
```

## Security Considerations

### Advantages
- ✅ Provides backup admin access
- ✅ Useful for operational teams
- ✅ Flexible for platform management
- ✅ Easy to implement and maintain

### Important Notes
- ⚠️ First user should be a trusted address
- ⚠️ Keep first user wallet secure
- ⚠️ Both admins have equal access to all functions
- ⚠️ Consider who registers as first user carefully

## Best Practices

### During Deployment
1. Deploy contract with owner wallet
2. Register first user with trusted wallet
3. Verify both wallets have admin access
4. Secure both wallet private keys

### For Production
1. Use hardware wallets for both admin addresses
2. Keep private keys in secure locations
3. Consider multi-sig for critical operations
4. Document both admin addresses securely

### Security Recommendations
- Never share private keys
- Use different wallets for owner and first user
- Keep backups of both wallets
- Test admin access before going live
- Monitor admin actions regularly

## Changing Admin Access

### To Remove First User Access
Modify `lib/hooks/useIsOwner.ts` to only check contract owner:
```typescript
// Remove the user ID check section
// Keep only the owner address check
```

### To Add More Admins
You can extend the logic to check for additional user IDs or addresses:
```typescript
// Check for multiple user IDs
if ([1, 2, 3].includes(Number(userId))) {
  return true;
}

// Or check specific addresses
const adminAddresses = ['0x...', '0x...'];
if (adminAddresses.includes(address.toLowerCase())) {
  return true;
}
```

## Verification

### How to Verify Admin Access

1. **Check Contract Owner**:
   ```
   - Go to BSCScan
   - View contract
   - Check owner() function
   ```

2. **Check First User**:
   ```
   - Call getUserIdByAddress(address)
   - Should return 1 for first user
   ```

3. **Test Admin Access**:
   ```
   - Connect with owner wallet → Should access /admin
   - Connect with first user wallet → Should access /admin
   - Connect with other wallet → Should redirect to home
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### First User Can't Access Admin
**Possible Causes**:
- Not actually user ID 1
- Wallet not connected
- Wrong network
- Not registered yet

**Solutions**:
1. Verify user ID with contract
2. Ensure wallet is connected
3. Check network (testnet vs mainnet)
4. Complete registration first

### Owner Can't Access Admin
**Possible Causes**:
- Wrong wallet connected
- Contract ownership transferred
- Network issue

**Solutions**:
1. Verify owner address on contract
2. Check if ownership was transferred
3. Reconnect wallet
4. Check network connection

## Current Configuration

- **Access Method**: Contract owner OR User ID 1
- **Verification**: Real-time on page load
- **Redirect**: Non-admins go to home page
- **Refresh**: Checks every 2 minutes
- **File**: `lib/hooks/useIsOwner.ts`

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Role-based access control (different admin levels)
- Multiple admin addresses
- Time-based admin access
- Admin action logging
- Admin access revocation system

### For Enterprise Use
Consider implementing:
- Multi-signature requirements
- Admin action approval workflow
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- Separate read-only admin role
- Emergency admin access procedures
